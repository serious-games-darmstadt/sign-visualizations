# Sign Visualizations

All visualizations presented here were created for various sign language recognition research projects and are taken from American Sign Language (ASL) unless otherwise noted.

The graphics can be used freely as long as this repository and the authors (Achenbach, Philipp and Fohrmann, Katharina and Volkov, Ilya, 2022) are referenced.

## Poses

A few sample poses for the following signs of ASL:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="poses/cool.png" alt="Type 0: Throw" width="240px"></td>
    <td><img src="poses/horse.png" alt="Type 1: Meet" width="240px"></td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cool</td>
    <td>Horse</td>
   </tr>
</table>

## [Battison](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.582.7797&rep=rep1&type=pdf)'s four types of signs

According to Battison (1978) [[1]](#1), there are four different types of signs:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="battison's_four_types_of_signs_poses/throw.png" alt="Type 0: Throw" width="180px"></td>
    <td><img src="battison's_four_types_of_signs_poses/meet.png" alt="Type 1: Meet" width="180px"></td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type 0: One-handed signs—e.g., [THROW](https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=throw)</td>
    <td>Type 1: Two active hands with the same handshape performing the same movement (synchronized or alternating)—e.g., [MEET](https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=meet)</td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="battison's_four_types_of_signs_poses/remember.png" alt="Type 2: Remember" width="180px"></td>
    <td><img src="battison's_four_types_of_signs_poses/write.png" alt="Type 3: Write" width="180px"></td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type 2: Two-handed signs with one active and one passive hand, both with the same handshape—e.g., [REMEMBER](https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=remember) ([Alternative](https://www.signingsavvy.com/search/remember))</td>
    <td>Type 3: Two-handed signs with an active and a passive hand, each having a different handshape—e.g., [WRITE](https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=write)</td>
   </tr>
</table>

Battison (1978) [[1]](#1) also established two combination rules for the hands that are valid for all sign languages:

- **Symmetry** rule: If both hands move at the same time, they have the same hand shape (Type 1).
- **Dominance** rule: If the dominant and non-dominant hands have different handshapes, only the dominant hand moves and the non-dominant hand has one of the [#unmarked-handshapes] (Type 3).

## Unmarked Handshapes

According to Battison (1978) [[1]](#1), the unmarked handshapes are those handshapes used by the non-dominant hand. They are also the handshapes first learned by children and are used in all known sign languages. For more information, see [here](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=439).

Depending on the source, six [[2]](#2), seven [[1]](#1) or eight [[3]](#3) different gestures are mentioned.
