# Sign Visualizations

All visualizations presented here originate from American Sign Language (ASL) and were created for different research projects around sign language recognition.

## Poses

A few sample poses for the following signs of ASL:

- [x] Cool
- [x] Horse

## [Battison](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.582.7797&rep=rep1&type=pdf)'s four types of signs

According to Battison (1978), there are four different types of signs:

- [x] one-handed signs—e.g., [THROW](https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=throw)
- [x] two active hands with the same handshape performing the same movement (synchronized or alternating)—e.g., [MEET](https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=meet)
- [x] two-handed signs with one active and one passive hand, both with the same handshape—e.g., [REMEMBER](https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=remember) ([Alternative](https://www.signingsavvy.com/search/remember))
- [x] two-handed signs with an active and a passive hand, each having a different handshape—e.g., [WRITE](https://asl-lex.org/visualization/?sign=write)

## Handshapes

### Unmarked Handshapes

According to Battison (1978), the unmarked handshapes are those handshapes that are used by the non-dominant hand. They are also the handshapes that are learned first by children. More infos [here](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=439).

- [x] a
- [x] a_open (å)
- [x] b_contact
- [x] c
- [x] o
- [ ] s
- [x] 1
- [x] 5

### Marked Handshapes

Marked Handshapes are all other handshapes. For a list of some handshapes [see here](https://github.com/serious-games-darmstadt/sign-visualizations/blob/main/handshapes.pdf) and in the following figure.
