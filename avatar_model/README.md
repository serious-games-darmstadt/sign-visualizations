The folder avatar_model includes a Maya rig scene file "Avatar_RIG_001.ma", an exported FBX file "Avatar_001.fbx" and the associated textures for the body "Body_BaseColor.png", "Body_Roughness.png", cloth "Cloth_Base_color.png", "Cloth_Normal.png", "Cloth_Roughness.png", eyes "Eyes_BaseColor.png", "Eyes_Normal.png", and shoes "Shoes_BaseColor.png". 

The rig was created with Maya 2022 and Advanced Skeleton 5.855. The Images were rendered with MtoA 4.2.1./Arnold 6.2.0.1. 
Best practice for working with the rig is referencing it into a new scene. The model can then be animated in the new scene with a non destructive workflow.

In order to animate with a different software the model in the FBX must be rigged freshly.
